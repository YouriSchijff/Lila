Lila is a personal project that began in 2023, and now it is being completely reworked. Mostly created to learn about game engines and to have a long term project to work on. This repository is open-source, and will hopefully help people to learn how to make a game engine too.

We tried to make Lila as easy to read as possible, while still being some what optimized. Some things will change because we are always learning how to write better, cleaner and faster code.

Documentation will be added in the future.
