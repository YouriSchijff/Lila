## 💡 Philosophy

Lila is a personal project that began in 2023, and it is currently being reworked from scratch. It was primarily created to learn about game engines and as a long-term project. This repository is free and open-source, and hopefully, it will help people learn how to make a game engine too.

Lila is designed to be easy to read while still being optimized. Some things are going to change because we are always learning how to write better, cleaner, and faster code.

Lila does not include an editor, but in the future, there will be a repository for an editor plugin.
